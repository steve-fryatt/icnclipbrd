=============================================================================
IcnClipBrd - Global Clipboard in writable icons

Important Upgrade Information for users of version 0.17        29 August 2020
=============================================================================


  IcnClipBrd 0.20 changes the way in which its keypresses are configured.
  Users upgrading from version 0.17 or earlier should read this release note
  before starting to upgrade their copy to a later version.



Does this affect me?
--------------------

  1) Are you currently using IcnClipBrd 0.17 or earlier?

  2) Have you customised IcbClipBrd in any way: for example altering the
     active keypresses or changing the date and time format?

  If the answer to either of these questions is "no", then these changes do
  NOT affect you. You should proceed directly to upgrading, as described in
  "How do I upgrade my copy of IcnClipBrd?" below.

  However, if you are using IcnClipBrd on a version of RISC OS which supports
  the clipboard in writable icons, you are advised to carefully read the
  notes in "What if I'm using RISC OS 5.27 from 2020 or later, or RISC OS
  Select?" below, and the corresponding section of the documentation.



If I might be affected, what do I need to do?
---------------------------------------------

  Before upgrading your copy of IcnClipBrd, take a copy of the configuration,
  which by default is stored in the !IcnClpBrd.Configure file. Once you have
  completed the upgrade, you can then modify the new Configure file which
  came with the update so that it has the same effect as your existing
  configuration.



How do I upgrade my copy of IcnClipBrd?
---------------------------------------

  IcnClipBrd can be upgraded in the usual way: delete the existing
  application, and replace it with version 0.20 (or later).

  If you copy the new application over the old, make sure that the new
  !IcnClpBrd.Configure file is copied across and is not blocked by the
  Filer's Newer setting.



If I need to update my configuration, what do I do?
---------------------------------------------------

  IcnClipBrd 0.20 changes the way that it stores the key configurations so
  that in addition to turning actions on and off, it is now possible to
  set which keys those actions are bound to.

  By default, the configuration is stored in the !IcnClpBrd.Configure file
  which can be accessed by Shift-double-clicking on the !IcnClpBrd
  application to open its directory. The file can then be loaded in to a
  text editor with a Shift-double-click in the usual way.

  The affected line within the file is the one which reads something like

    IcnClipBrdKeys 2_0011111111

  which has been replaced by a new version of the "*IcnClipBrdKeys" command
  taking a list of option parameters in the usual RISC OS format instead of
  a single bitwise flag value as before.

  If the existing configuration uses the number "2_0011111111" as above, then
  this is the default and the new configuration file can be left as it is
  with all of its lines commented out using vertical bars ("|").

  If the value is different, then a new "*IcnClipBrdKeys" command will need
  to be built up by checking each of the digits of the old value in turn.


  Creating a new configuration
  ----------------------------

  To create a new "*IcnClipBrdKeys" command, start with the command at the
  start of a new line in the Configure file (perhaps use one of the example
  lines in the file's comments as a template to work from):

    IcnClipBrdKeys

  Now check each digit in the old configuration and append options to the
  command as necessary. If the highlighted digits are 0 and not 1, then
  IcnClipBrd defaults to this behaviour and does not need to be told to apply
  it.

  * If the value contained 2_1xxxxxxxxx then add "-DateTime Ctrl-T".

  * If the value contained 2_x1xxxxxxxx then add "-SwapCase Ctrl-s".

  For example, if the original configuration was

    IcnClipBrdKeys 2_1111111111

  then this would result in a new configuration of

    IcnClipBrdKeys -SwapCase Ctrl-S -DateTime Ctrl-T

  The remaining digits are slightly different, as they default to being on
  and need to be turned off if required. In this case, if the highlighted
  digits are 1 then IcnClipBrd's default behaviour is correct and there is no
  need to add a parameter to the configuration.

  * If the value contained 2_xx0xxxxxxx then add "-Overwrite Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxx0xxxxxx then add "-Cut Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxx0xxxxx then add "-Paste Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxxx0xxxx then add "-Quote Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxxxx0xxx then add "-DelLeft Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxxxxx0xx then add "-Filename Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxxxxxx0x then add "-Extension Off".

  * If the value contained 2_xxxxxxxxx0 then add "-Copy Off".

  For example, if the original configuration was

    IcnClipBrdKeys 2_0111111110

  then this would result in a new configuration of

    IcnClipBrdKeys -SwapCase Ctrl-S -Copy Off

  The method of setting the date and time format, using a line similar to

    Set IcnClipBrd$DateFormat %WE %DY%ST %MO %CE%YR

  remains unchanged, so any existing configuration can be safely used with
  IcnClipBrd 0.20 or later.



What if I'm using RISC OS 5.27 from 2020 or later, or RISC OS Select?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Since 2020, RISC OS 5.27 has natively supported the global clipboard in
  writable icons, in a similar manner to RISC OS Select (RISC OS 4 and Six).

  On these systems, it is advisable to allow the Window Manager to handle
  cut, copy and paste operations -- which can require additional changes
  to the configuration. See the "Use on RISC OS 5 and RISC OS Select"
  section of the documentation for details.
